# ML-learning-journy
My journey learning Python for Data Science and Machine Learning
🎯 This repository tracks my hands-on progress through the **Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp** on Udemy and other resources as I build data science and machine learning skills.

## 📚 Course Focus
- Python basics for data
- NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib
- Seaborn and Plotly for visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models
- TensorFlow for deep learning

## 🧠 My Goals
- Build strong Python foundations
- Learn by doing real projects
- Apply concepts in small ML projects
- Share my progress consistently

  ## 🗂️ Project Structure

Each folder corresponds to a major topic:

- `01-python-basics/`: Notebooks from the Python crash course section  
- `02-numpy/`: Exercises and summaries for NumPy  
- `03-pandas/`: Data wrangling practice  
- `summaries/`: Short topic summaries in Markdown  
- `resources/`: Helpful external resources (to be added)

- *More to be added as I progress through the course.*
